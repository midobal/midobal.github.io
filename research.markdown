**Covid-19 MultiLingual Information Access (Covid-19 MLIA).** *[Website](http://eval.covid19-mlia.eu/)*. *[MT repo](https://github.com/midobal/covid19mlia-mt-task)*.
{: .justify .title}
Community effort to boost the development of language resources and multilingual information access systems specifically tailored on Covid-19. It is promoted by several communities which are closely working together. Supported by the *European Commission*, the *European Language Resources Coordination*, the *European Language Resources Association*, the *European Research Infrastructure for Language Resources and Technology* and the *CLEF Initiative*.<br />
{: .project .justify}
*The machine translation task aims to organize a community evaluation effort with the intents of accelerating the creation of resources and tools for improving the generation of MT systems focused on Covid-19 related documents.* <br />

**Deep learning for adaptative and multimodal Interaction in pattern recognition (DeepPattern).**
{: .justify .title}
Research project supported by the *Generalitat Valenciana (GVA)* under the reference *PROMETEO/2019/121*. <br />
{: .project .justify}
*This project follows past PROMETEO projects. Its goal is to incorporate deep neural networks and recurrent neural networks to interactive and multimodal pattern recognition from a deep learning approach. And to apply these techniques to several tasks such as interactive machine translation, handwritten text recognition, information retrieval and indexing from images, recognition of mathematical expressions, author profiling and multimodal speech recognition.* <br />

**Desarrollo de una Plataforma de Traducción Automática Utilizando Técnicas de Hibridación Sobre un Núcleo de Traducción Basado en Redes Neuronales.**
{: .justify .title}
Research project registered under the project *Hybrid Neural Machine Translation Platform*, developed by the company *Pangeanic* with support from the *Centro Para el Desarrollo Tecnológico Industrial (CDTI)* and the *European Union* under *Programa Operativo de Crecimiento Inteligente* (reference *IDI-20170964*). <br />
{: .project .justify}
*The goal of this project was to create a hybrid neural machine translation platform that profits from the company's current machine translation framework to create a new translation core based on neural machine translation that created added value for the professional users and the clients.* <br />
{: .summary .justify}
I worked as a researcher helping in the development of this platform and incorporating an incremental learning framework.

**Adaptive Learning and MultimodAlity in MAchine Translation and tExt tRanscription (ALMAMATER).**
{: .justify .title}
Research project supported by the *Generalitat Valenciana (GVA)* under the reference *PROMETEOII/2014/030*. <br />
{: .project .justify}
*This project followed past PROMETEO projects based on profiting from the user's feedback on interactive pattern recognition approaches. Its goal was to retrain the system using the data produced during the feedback process to adapt the system to the user's behavior and the task's particularities; explore the multimodality inherent in the interaction in order to improve the overall behavior and usability of the system; and apply the developed techniques to the fields of handwritten text recognition, machine translation and image retrieval.* <br />
