Hi there, welcome to my website! I'm Miguel Domingo. I'm a postdoctoral fellow at [Universitat Politècnica de València](http://www.upv.es/) and a member of [PRHLT Research Center](https://www.prhlt.upv.es). My research interests include machine learning, computational linguistics and their applications to machine translation, computer-assisted translation and the processing of historical documents. I co-organized the machine translation shared task of the [Covid-19 MultiLingual Information Access initiative](http://eval.covid19-mlia.eu/), and I have also participated in 2 projects funded by the Spanish government and 2 regional projects. I am the coauthor of 20 articles in international journals and proceedings of international conferences, and I have served in program committees of 20 international conferences and workshops.

**2015&ndash;2022** <br />
{: .timeline .ident}
**Ph.D.** - *[Universitat Politècnica de València](http://www.upv.es/)*. <br />
I did a Ph.D. in computer science at the [PRHLT Research Center](https://www.prhlt.upv.es). It was mainly focused on interactive machine translation and on applying machine translation to some tasks related with the processing of historical documents (language modernization and spelling normalization). I was awarded the [second accesit from AERFAI's best Ph.D. award](documents/PhDaward.pdf). *Ph.D.'s thesis: [Some Contributions to Interactive Machine Translation and to the Applications of Machine Translation for Historical Documents](documents/PhDdissertation.pdf)*.

**2014&ndash;2015** <br />
{: .timeline .ident}
**Master's degree** - *[Universitat Politècnica de València](http://www.upv.es/)*. <br />
I did a M.Sc. in artificial intelligence, pattern recognition and digital imaging, focusing on interactive machine translation and automatic post-editing. Master's thesis: *[Interactive Post-Editing in Machine Translation](https://riunet.upv.es/handle/10251/64251)*.

**2008&ndash;2014** <br />
{: .timeline .ident}
**Engineer's degree** - *[Universitat Politècnica de València](http://www.upv.es/)*. <br />
I did a B.Sc. in computer science (computer science engineer), focusing on artificial intelligence and formal languages. I spent half a year at [Edinburgh Napier University](https://www.napier.ac.uk/) taking courses on sound design and security and forensic computing. My Bachelor's thesis (*[Reconocedor Automático de Melodías
de Música Clásica](https://riunet.upv.es/handle/10251/45907)*) was focused on identifying classical melodies from a fragment of it, a hum, a whistle or an *a cappella* fragment (only for songs with lyrics).
