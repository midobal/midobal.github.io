Hi there, welcome to my website! I'm Miguel Domingo. I work as a Ph.D. researcher at the [PRHLT Research Center](https://www.prhlt.upv.es) from [Universitat Politècnica de València](http://www.upv.es/). I have mainly worked in machine translation and historical document processing, but my interests also include pattern recognition and machine learning.

**Ph.D.** - *[Universitat Politècnica de València](http://www.upv.es/)*. <br />
I did a Ph.D. in computer science at the [PRHLT Research Center](https://www.prhlt.upv.es). It was mainly focused on interactive machine translation and on applying machine translation to some tasks related with the processing of historical documents (language modernization and spelling normalization). *Ph.D.'s thesis: [Some Contributions to Interactive Machine Translation and to the Applications of Machine Translation for Historical Documents](documents/PhDdissertation.pdf)*.

{: .timeline .ident}
**Master's degree** - *[Universitat Politècnica de València](http://www.upv.es/)*. <br />
I did a M.Sc. in artificial intelligence, pattern recognition and digital imaging, focusing on interactive machine translation and automatic post-editing. Master's thesis: *[Interactive Post-Editing in Machine Translation](https://riunet.upv.es/handle/10251/64251)*.

**2008&ndash;2014** <br />
{: .timeline .ident}
**Engineer's degree** - *[Universitat Politècnica de València](http://www.upv.es/)*. <br />
I did a B.Sc. in computer science (computer science engineer), focusing on artificial intelligence and formal languages. I spent half a year at [Edinburgh Napier University](https://www.napier.ac.uk/) taking courses on sound design and security and forensic computing. My Bachelor's thesis (*[Reconocedor Automático de Melodías
de Música Clásica](https://riunet.upv.es/handle/10251/45907)*) was focused on identifying classical melodies from a fragment of it, a hum, a whistle or an *a cappella* fragment (only for songs with lyrics).
